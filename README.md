# Domestic Violence Propagation Model

This study uses a propagation model to analyze data on domestic violence calls and complaints in Mexico City during the COVID-19 pandemic. The model showed a good correlation with the real data of calls, but not with the real data of complaints, suggesting that it can accurately describe the dynamics of domestic violence during the pandemic, and that the tools of Complexity Science are appropriate to capture the interactions between the components of the system and the environment, and to visualize emerging behaviors that cannot be described only from individual behaviors.

## Research Team

The research was conducted by a team in the context of a Complexity Workshop of the Master's degree in Complexity Science of the UACM (Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México)

## Results

The results of the study suggest that the proposed propagation model can accurately capture the dynamics of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic and that complexity science tools are appropriate for understanding this issue.
